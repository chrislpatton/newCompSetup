# New Computer Checklist
Welcome to Tommy John! Let's get your computer set up:

## Install Git
First we need to install git for version control.
[Git Installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Install Node for your OS
Install NodeJS onto your computer.
[NodeJS Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Install NVM
Some projects will require to run with an older version of node, so we will need NVM to switch between versions.
The best way to install would be to run the following command into your terminal or command prompt:
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash
```

## Install Slack
Our team uses slack to communicate, so install slack onto your computer, and we recommend you install the slack app onto your mobile device as well. Go to [Tommy John's Slack Page](https://tjhq.slack.com) to set up an account with your Tommy John email address.

## Create Github account for Tommy John Work
Make a github account specifically for the work you will be doing here at Tommy John and send your mentor or team leader the username to be given access to your relevant project repositories.

## Install Coding Environment
Install your text editor, terminal, config files, and/or any other tools you will need for your coding workflow.

## Install Stencil
We will be using [Stencil](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/), a BigCommerce framework, to work on project Sails. The following steps are required to install Stencil:
1. ```npm install -g stencil```
2. ```npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli```
3. Get your stencil configured with your own Client ID, Access token, and the link to the store API from your team leader.
4. ```stencil start``` and you're ready to roll!
